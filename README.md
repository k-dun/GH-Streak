# GH-Streak

A Chrome extension that displays your recent GitHub contribution activity and current streak on (almost) every webpage you visit.

## About

Duolingo has me in a chokehold. I downloaded that app 123 days ago. My current streak is 123 days!
Turns out a bit of gamification and visual prompting will force my chaotic neurodivergent *** into consistency. This app is the first step in me trying to implement those things into my developer journey. 

A small Google Chrome extension that displays your last 28 days Github Contributions graph on a small bar showing up on almost every website. It's still buggy, but even when it doesn't look perfect (or show up at all for that matter due to individual website's settings), it still does the job of giving a more persistent visual prompt reminding one to be consistent.
